# Wordle_Solver
Solves the internet game called wordle
Uses an arrayList with a linked string value as a basis for storing words (wordDict) and uses an array of wordDicts to hold all words in containers that correspond to 
a possible "code" from a guess and potential answers. Can solve for best first word based on minimizing the number of remaining words and also solve a round of Wordle. The file answers.txt gives the program the option of only picking words that are actual answers in Wordle, while wordleGuesses gives all possible answers to the program.
